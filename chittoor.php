<p style = "font-size:200%"><i> The history of this temple is worth knowing. About a 1000 years ago, there lived three physically-disabled brothers. While one of the brothers was blind, the other was dumb and the third was deaf. They earned their modest living by cultivating a small piece of land close to Viharapuri village.

On a certain day, when one of the brothers was irrigating the land via different channels, the other two were drawing the water from a well using the Piccota System. During the task, to their utter dismay, they discovered that the water of the well had dried up. One of the brothers got down the well and began digging its bed with an iron spade. Soon after commencing this job, he was awe-struck to realise that his spade has been floundering about in the waters and hitting a stone-like object underneath</i></p>
