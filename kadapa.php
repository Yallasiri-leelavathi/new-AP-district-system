<p style = "font-size:200%"><i>The history of Kshetram dates back to the period of the Ramayana, Treta Yuga. According to the legend, Lord Rama himself had drawn the picture of Lord Hanuman on the rock with his arrow while resting at this place, and was receiving the hospitality of Lord Vayu (God of Air and Father of Lord Hanuman). Lord Sri Rama has completed the drawing of Lord Hanuman except the little finger of Lord Hanuman's left hand. Later Vyasaraja has sculptured this drawing into an idol, while Vyasaraja tried to sculpt even the little finger of Lord Hanuman's left hand, it is said that the finger of the idol was cut off by itself and started bleeding. Which displays Lord Hanuman's intention to keep the idol as drawn by Lord Sri Rama</i></p>
