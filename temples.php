The Temple is dedicated to Venkateswara, a form of Vishnu, who is believed to have appeared on the earth to save mankind from trials and troubles of Kali Yuga.

The temple is also known by other names like Tirumala Temple, Tirupati Temple and Tirupati Balaji Temple. Venkateswara is known by many other names: Balaji, Govinda, and Srinivasa.

After the end of Vijayanagara Empire, the temple went into the hands of Golconda in July 1656 and then it was under the French for a short period of time and under Nawab of Carnatic till 1801 CE. With the advent of British during the early 19th century, the management of the temple passed to hands of East India Company, who accorded special status to temple and avoided interference in temple activities.[23] Madras government passed Regulation seven of 1817, which passed the temple to Board of Revenue through collector of North Arcot District.[23] In 1821, Mr. Bruce, the then East India company commissioner for Chittoor district, had drawn rules for the management of Temple which is referred to as Bruce's Code.[23] The 7th Nizam of Hyderabad, Mir Osman Ali Khan donated ₹8,000 to the temple</i></p>

<img src="image/aa.jpg"width = "40%" height ="40%" style="float:right">
<p style = "font-size:100%"><i>This sacred Hindu pilgrim center is located on a hilltop called Ratnagiri. There´s a story how the name Ratnagiri came to be called. Meruvu, the lord of the hills and his consort Menaka did great penance and begot two sons by the grace of Lord Vishnu. One was named Bhadra and the other Ratnakar. Bhadra pleased Lord Vishnu with his devotion and penance and with His grace became Bhadrachalam on which Lord Sri Rama had permanently settled. Ratnakara desired to emulate his brother and succeeded in pleasing Lord Vishnu by his penance and with His grace became Ratnagiri (hill) on which Lord Sri Vishnu settled on him as Lord Sri Veera Venkata Satyanarayana Swamy. Later, a temple was built in 1891 by Sri I.V. Ramanarayana, a zamindar, as said to have been commanded by the Lord in his dream. The idol was traced from the hill and placed at the current spot which we now know as Annavaram. <br>
The Temple is built in the dravidian style and the glory and richness of lord satyadeva was widely described in revakhanda of skandhapuranam. The presiding deity is lord satyadeva with his consort sri anantha lakshmi on one side and with lord siva on the other side. He has taken a beautiful manifested form of the divine trinity namely hari hara hiranya garbha thrimurtyatmaka. This place is enriched by the installation of srimathripathvibhuti vykhunta maha narayana yantra, which plays a dominant and important role with the power of attraction of money (dhana janakarsha). The peetham of swamy varu is highly adorned with the installation of panchayatana befitting the glory and sanctity of the deity. The main temple constructed in the form of a chariot with the four wheels at each of the four corners</i></p>
